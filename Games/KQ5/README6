MIDI synthesizers
-----------------
     Multimedia Windows defines two types of synthesizers; 
"base-level" which includes three melodic channels and one percussive 
channel, and "extended" which includes nine melodic channels and one 
percussive channel.  The channel assignments are 13 thru 16 for the 
former and 1 thru 10 for the latter. You may configure the system 
depending upon the type of sound equipment installed by using the 
MIDI Mapper in the control panel. Sierra's games can play music for 
either of these configurations. The installation procedure allows you 
to choose which is appropriate for your system. If you don't know what 
type of synthesizer you have, just click on "OK" to select the 
base-level synthesizer.  
     If you wish to change the synthesizer, you must re-install
the game and use the MIDI Mapper to change the channel assignments.
     If you encounter difficulties playing KQV CD on a PS-1, it may
be due to the music card selections.
     Should you encounter difficulties with your ProAudio Spectrum
playing KQV CD with Windows 3.1 please contact Media Vision to
determine the proper drivers to obtain. The wave driver (mvwave.drv)
for the ProAudio Spectrum that is supplied with Windows 3.0 with 
Multimedia extensions, works correctly with Windows 3.1 if Windows 3.1
is installed over Windows 3.0 with Multimedia extensions.
