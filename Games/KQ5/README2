               ---------------------------------------------------


From the CD (if no setup floppy is supplied with the game)
----------------------------------------------------------

   1. Insert the game CD into the CD-ROM drive.

   2. Invoke Windows.

   3. Select "Run..." from the "File" menu.

   4. Type "x:\setup" where "x" is the drive letter of your CD-ROM 
      drive.  Press Return or click "OK".

   5. The setup program will now run automatically.  It will suggest
      a directory for installation but allow you to change it if you
      wish. It will ask	whether you wish to output background music 
		for a base-level or for an extended synthesizer (see below).  
		It will then copy the required files to your hard disk and set
      up a program group and program icon so that you may play the game.
