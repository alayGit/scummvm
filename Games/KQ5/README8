Color rendering
---------------
     Because of certain limitations of the Windows environment,
Sierra games run under Windows do not have the full range of
colors available that they do when run under DOS.  The difference
is usually not noticeable, but you may occasionally see parts
of some pictures which are not true colors.  If you wish to
see the true colors, then play the game under DOS.


Screen savers
-------------
     The use of screen savers which use color (such as "Mystify"
which comes with the Multimedia extensions) will cause the game
colors to be inaccurate.
