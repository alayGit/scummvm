                       --------------------------


DOS installation
----------------

	To run the game without installing, all you do is type Sierra.
Please note that you will run with the default music and sound 
configuration.  You also will have no default save game directory,
and will need to choose one manually should you decide to save.


Slow machine notes
------------------

	Instead of the opening and closing cartoons, you may receive a
"slide show."	You will see the slide show if you are on a slow
machine, or if you have an MCGA type graphics adapter.  The
slide show contains no animation, and simply displays pictures
that go with the story.
