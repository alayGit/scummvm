Video display drivers
---------------------

     Under the Multimedia extensions to Windows, there are a number of video
display drivers which may be used.  These may be examined and changed by
selecting the "Display" icon in the control panel or by using the Windows
setup program.  Sierra games look best using a driver which is capable of 
displaying 256 colors at a resolution of 640x480 pixels (such as the Video 7 
board with 512K memory), but will also run at lower resolutions and with 
fewer colors.  Various board manufacturers will supply their own Windows 
drivers.  When a Sierra game starts up under Windows, it examines the 
capabilities of the video driver you are using. If the game does not support 
that driver, it displays a box with the following message:
	 "Your current display driver is not supported by this game.
	  You can install a different driver by selecting the appropriate
	  options from the control panel.  You may also exit Windows and
	  install and play the game under DOS."

The title to the box will display the name of the driver you are using.
