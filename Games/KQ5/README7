Memory usage
------------
     Your Windows installation guide contains suggestions for optimizing
memory usage.  Sierra has found that using non-Windows memory managers such
as QEMM may cause unpredictable results including system crashes.
     A base-level MPC machine has sufficient memory to play Sierra games.
However, as additional applications are invoked, less memory is available.
At some point, one of the applications will report an out-of-memory
condition.  To avoid this situation, do not run numerous other applications
concurrent with the game.


Windows modes
-------------
     Windows can be run in one of three modes: Real, Standard,
and Enhanced.  Sierra games will run in either Standard or Enhanced
mode, but not in Real mode.
